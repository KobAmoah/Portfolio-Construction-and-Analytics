# Portfolio-Construction-and-Analytics
      I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I might learn how to do it.
                                                                            - Pablo Picasso
                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 This work is an attempt focusing on two main components of the portfolio management process. These components are:
   - Portfolio weighting
   - Portfolio performance evaluation
   
 The motivation is to explore the idea of 'Diversification' as it relates to how different weighting schemes of a portfolio's constituents affect the overall portfolio performance. The weighting schemes explored are
   - Equal Weight
   - Markowitz
   - Black-Litterman
   - Covariance-Robust Optimization
   
 The portfolio is assumed to consist of 9 ETFs: SPY(S&P 500), IWM(Russell 2000), FEZ(Euro Stoxx 50), ACWI (MSCI All-Country World), ACG(Barclays Aggregate US Bond), IAGG(iShares Core  International Aggregate Bond), IYR(Dow Jones US Real Estate), REET(iShares Global REIT), and GSG(iShares GSCI Commodity Index).
    
 If you would like to send me suggestions or comments on the project, please send them to my email address with the title "Portfolio - Construction Comments." I'd be pleased to receive your feedback. 
 
 Lastly, I would like to pay specific gratitude to Dr. Dale Rosenthal (Q36 LLC). This work was inspired by his book and my numerous consultations with him. I'd also like to thank Dr. Craig Knuckles (Lake Forest College) for his unwavering support during the project's undertaking.
