# Portfolio-Construction-and-Analytics
The first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
                                                            - George Orwell

        This work is an ongoing attempt focusing on two main components of the portfolio management process. These components are:
        - Portfolio weighting
        - Portfolio performance evaluation

        If you would like to send me suggestions or comments on the project, please send them to my email address with the title "Portfolio - Construction Comments."
